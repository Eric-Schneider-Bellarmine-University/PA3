    "### A. Write a Python program will calculate the area and perimeter of a triangle using two different functions named calcArea() and calcPerimeter(). Your program should prompt the user for the length of three sides of the triangle. Each function should take the lengths of the sides as arguments and return the output of their respective calculations. As an added feature, set the default values of your parameters to 1 so if you call either function without parameters, it will still produce output) (I recommend using Heron’s Method for calculating the area of a triangle.)"
